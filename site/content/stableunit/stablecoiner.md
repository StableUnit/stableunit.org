Compared to projects like Tether, our system is fully decentralized which guarantees that no-one can freeze your account or block a transaction. Ever. 

Unlike overcollateralized systems like Makerdao’s DAI, StableUnit offers unlimited scalability, which is essential for mass adoption on an international scale.

Multi-layer stabilization mechanism provides better protection in events of market instability compared to “Seigniorage share” stablecoins, like Basis and others.
