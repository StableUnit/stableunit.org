What is stable units? People might mistakenly call it stablecoins, however that is not correct, because the word coin implies that it is made from finite supply metal therefore it is inherently unstable. 
Big network and small network have very different properties. There’s a law which says that the value of the network is proportional for square of the numbers of user who use it. We use the assumption that with increasing number of users, a p2p payment network start having native value because some people will receive or sending it as a payments therefore believe that it worth something. (Precisely same reason why dogecoin has bigger than zero price - people, even out of the pure fun send it to each other for something therefore value it at not totally zero cost therefore the hole network have some value). On another hand, a small network doesn’t have that value so it’s essentially that user have a reason that it worth something. One of this reason might be strong believe that it might receive bigger adaptation in the future and coupled with finite supply it the price will only grow. Another reason that this tokens might have some utility - can be exchange on goods of services. And might be the reason that it can be exchange on other already popular cryptocurrency which has a some price. 
Based on the arguments mentioned above - we can create hybrid: 

- when the network in small - put some sum on cryptocurrency into collateral, sufficient to exchange all units in the circulation. Users can be ensure that they are able to exchange all their units to the crypto from reserve by the market price in several conditions are true:
- It’s not too many units in the circulation so collateral is large enough to cover that
- The price of the crypto in the collateral is not too law, so these in enough money to cover units
- Users are able to do that: that system is not hackers, closed by regulations, this fund are not under control of single entity who have a way to take this money (hi Tether)
