Bitcoin, despite all of its advantages, is an inconvenient form of money because of its volatility.

 **StableUnit** is a **decentralized** cryptocurrency that is **stable**. 1SU=1USD. Always. How? StableUnit has automatic mechanisms that stabilize the price no matter what is happening in the markets. Like an **open-source bank** controlled by every user via voting and with no central authority.

Compared to projects like Tether, our system is fully decentralized which guarantees that no-one can freeze your account or block a transaction. Ever. 

Unlike overcollateralized systems like Makerdao’s DAI, StableUnit offers unlimited scalability, which is essential for mass adoption on an international scale.

Multi-layer stabilization mechanism provides better protection in events of market instability compared to “Seigniorage share” stablecoins, like Basis and others.
