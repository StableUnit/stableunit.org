- The system has two main tokens: 
  - StableUnit(SU)  - the core unit of the system with a stable price $1.
  - StableUnit DAO Share(SUDS)  - a volatile governance token and beneficiary of the system with a finite supply. 
- The system works as an open-source bank on a blockchain. The only difference is that itâ€™s completely decentralized and benefits all SUDS holders, not a few bankers or a government. 
- The system stores all profit in the reserve. Once a year it distributes unneeded reserve capital in the form of dividends to SUDS holders.
- SUDS holders participate and stake tokens in the DAO referendums. Miners and Oracles get a reward in SUDS.
