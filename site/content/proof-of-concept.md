## Short StableUnit overview

Bitcoin can’t be used as everyday cash, means of saving or international medium of exchange because of it volatile. StableUnit solved this problem by offering complete decentralized privacy stable currency. It’s fully backed by crypto collateral on growth stage. And utilizes black-swan resistant multi-layer stabilization mechanism on highest capitalization.

## MultiLayer Stabilization
![png](/concept/multilayer_stabilisation_sims.png)

In normal market conditions the price is stable because traders will buy SU when the price is below $1, knowing they can sell those SU to the stabilisation reserve instantly at $1 for profit – this drives the price back up, and works the same way in reverse when the price is above $1. When there are large changes to the amount held in the reserve because of sudden market events, such as people selling SU to capitalise on a sudden Bitcoin price increase, REPOs are available to buy with SU that can be redeemed for SU + interest when the reserve has been replenished – incentivising people to push the price back up during market shocks. If there is too much supply pressure for REPOs to handle, then DAO tokens will be created and used to replenish the reserve. As a last resort, people will be incentivized via interest to lock up their funds.
