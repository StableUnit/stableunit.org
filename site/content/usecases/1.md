title: "A low-volatility cryptocurrency for traders"
---
During periods of high volatility, traders may seek refuge in low-volatility assets like US dollars. However, in addition to potential tax implications, trading crypto to US dollars may create delays and additional complexity due to bank withdrawals. Trading back and forth in a low-volatility cryptocurrency may help avoid these issues and allow traders to work more efficiently.
