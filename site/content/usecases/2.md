Price-stable cryptocurrencies act as a gateway between fiat money and cryptocurrencies. For example, an investor who may want to try using cryptocurrency may not want to buy Bitcoin due to its notoriously volatile nature and instead may make a purchase of a price-stable cryptocurrency. Similarly, veteran traders may park funds in price-stable cryptocurrencies ready for trading opportunities allowing them much quicker access to deploy funds into other assets like Bitcoin rather than having to wait for the banking system and exchanges to clear these funds.
