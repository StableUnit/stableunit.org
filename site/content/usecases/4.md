International trading for countries which might prefer cryptocurrency for political reasons (i.e. Russia, Turkey, Jordan). 
In some jurisdictions, holding foreign currencies may be subject to additional taxes, capital controls or may be illegal. In addition, foreign currencies may be scarce due to these restrictions and black-market demand. For these reasons, some investors may choose to diversify their holdings into a price-stable cryptocurrency that may mimic the price of these foreign holdings without necessarily taking on the risks associated with them.
