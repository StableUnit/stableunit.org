# Information for contractors
If you receive contract offer for StableUnit, congratulations! When you successfully complete your work you can justly consider yourself a part of blockchain revolution!

## Compensation:

All payments are in bitcoins only.

## Typical workflow. 

You offer well written defined  scope of work (what will be done), time expectation and compensation. If it’s our first work together, we can work via sign contract and you’ll receive payment after work done with possibly little prepayment. We can divide contract in as many stages as you want.  Alternative way is an advance payment via escrow. Escrow is a 3rd company which will keep your money until the work is done. Later we can pay you directly. There would be absolutely no payment in advance without escrow if we haven’t work before. You don’t have any risk by working via escrow and we’ll compensate all fees.

We are making blockchain revolution and actively avoiding of using fiat money. If you haven’t use cryptocurrency before, here some tips (this’s only our recommendations and you are free to use different solutions):
