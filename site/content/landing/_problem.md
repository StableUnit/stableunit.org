- Majority of the countries [don't have](https://medium.com/@lebed.2045/fiat-currencies-are-s-coins-too-c0c47f9612b0) reliable national currency. StableUnit offers the stability of US dollar and decentralization of Bitcoin.

- Current proposals and implementation of stable currency [don't offer censorship resistance](https://blog.goodaudience.com/gemini-can-make-gusd-non-transferrable-at-any-moment-code-review-a28d58ef6a61). StableUnit does offer 100% decentralization.
