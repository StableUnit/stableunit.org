- Bitcoin canâ€™t be used as cash for everyday life because of its volatility. StableUnit solves this problem.

- The majority of countries [don't have](https://medium.com/@lebed.2045/fiat-currencies-are-s-coins-too-c0c47f9612b0) a reliable national currency. StableUnit offers the stability of the US dollar and the decentralization of Bitcoin.

- Current proposals and implementation of stable currencies [don't offer censorship-resistance](https://blog.goodaudience.com/gemini-can-make-gusd-non-transferrable-at-any-moment-code-review-a28d58ef6a61). StableUnit does offer 100% decentralization. 

- Crypto holders who want to exit volatility have to pass KYC, trust corporations and trade their assets on exchanges.  StableUnit smart contract exchanges SU in a completely decentralized way directly from a wallet.
