Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) which gets funded using an Initial Token Distribution (ITD/ICO).

Unlike ICOs, DAICO funds are released to the foundation in a manner that is tied to the completion of goals and investors are able to claim remainder of funds back if they are not satisfied with team’s performance.

### Stable Unit’s DAICO Fundraising:
- Stable Unit team does not receive all of the money immediately
- Funds are locked in the special smart-contract and unlocked by each milestone
- Every 6 months, the DAO_shareholders are able to vote to lock scheduled fund releases for an additional 3 months if the team has not met their promised goals
- After 2 such locks each investor is able to exchange shares for the remainder of their funds

This investment mechanism creates a strong motivation for the team to perform well and reduces the risk of losing funds for investors after the DAICO.
