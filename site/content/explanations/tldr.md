Bitcoin is an amazing new form of money that has defied the odds to gain increasing importance as money in the world today. Despite its great features that help make Bitcoin an unstoppable investment it has a problem; the *price swings prevents Bitcoin from gaining even more importance as money*. Stable coins are a new type of cryptocurrency that is entirely digital but whose price is always $1 US.

Our stable coin, called StableUnit, is a *new advanced type of stablecoin* that will have features that also make it unstoppable and uncensorable. These features include a multi-layer stability mechanism which helps *ensure that the price of the stablecoin is always the same as holding an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars*.
