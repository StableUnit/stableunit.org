      <div class="solution_text">
          <p>Let’s go through it line by line.</p>

          <p>Anthony: I don’t know when Vlad will release Casper, but I know that Mihai doesn’t know either.
          All Anthony knows is the month, and every month has more than one possible date, so of course he doesn’t know when the release date is.</p>
          <p>The only way that Mihai could know the date with a single number, however, would be if Vlad had told him 18 or 19, since of the ten date options only these numbers appear once, as May 19 and June 18.
          For Anthony to know that Mihai does not know, Anthony must therefore have been told July or August, since this rules out Mihai being told 18 or 19.</p>

          <p>Line 2)</p>
          <p>Mihai: At first I didn’t know when Vlad was planning the release Casper, but now I know.</p>
          <p>Mihai has deduced that Anthony has either August or July. If he knows the full date, he must have been told 15, 16 or 17, since if he had been told 14 he would be none the wiser about whether the month was August or July. Each of 15, 16 and 17 only refers to one specific month, but 14 could be either month.</p>

          <p>Line 3)</p>
          <p>Anthony: Then I also know when the release date  is.</p>
          <p>Anthony has therefore deduced that the possible dates are July 16, Aug 15 and Aug 17. For him to now know, he must have been told July. Since if he had been told August, he would not know which date for certain is the release date.</p>

          <p>The answer is therefore July 16.</p>

        <p>While Trevon James may be stupid for some of his antics, he is not that stupid: He understands that the conference is well-attended and that many many people would offer him this ‘bad deal’ just to see him repeat the foolish decision of accepting the lower valued Dogecoin. As a result, he would be better off if more than 10 people repeated the experiment on him during the conference.</p>

      <div class="solution_text">
        <p>We split the coins into 3 groups of 3 coins each. We weigh 2 groups. This determines which group has a fake. If the balance is equal, this implies that the 3rd group has a fake. And finally, breaking up the third group of three by measuring two coins would help determine which was fake. So this would take a minimum of two measurements.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>Money should be decentralized, private, and available for everyone. All of humanity, not just a small minority, should share the benefits and ownership of the financial system. Personal secure possession of value in the form of money should be a universal and inalienable human right.</p>
